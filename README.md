# Array With Non-Primitive Data Type

### Objective
In this project, we will explore using arrays with non-primitive data types to store and manipulate multiple instances of a class.
### Problem
Create an array of objects to store books information using the [Book](./src/Book.java) class.

### Implementation
Create three objects from the [`Book`](./src/Book.java) class with the provided information and store them in the `bookCollection` array.
